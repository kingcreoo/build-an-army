# build-an-army
Build an army is a simple, easy, aesthetically pleasing ROBLOX game. The player manages a team of soldiers that destroy targets endlessly, without the push of a button & even work when the player is offline.

## Notice
My ROBLOX game development journey has been a large part of my young life and I have spent a serious amount of time working on various games, most to incompletion. I have now reconsidered my alignment with ROBLOX and decided to release none of my games due to ROBLOX's mismanagement of their effect on our young children. I still plan on completing a few of my ideas and publishing devlogs overviewing my design and programming decisions on my website. 

This repo will stay public and acts as a window into my thought processes and written code. Below is an overview of project todos & all of the code in this repo is documented. However views of my 3D models and playtests of the game will only be available on my website, not here in this repo.
